      <p>
        Blind Upload is a non-profit service which allows you to encrypt and upload large files to
        the Internet, for other people to download and decrypt in their browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blind Upload remains ignorant of your files' content by performing encryption in your
        browser and by never uploading your keys.  (Keys are encoded as URL
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment" target="_">fragments</a> such as
        https://<wbr>www.blindupload.org/<wbr><b>#WL9IdULNh5h3tb7PISPWdu<wbr>X3nNp9ghYWpZa91L5hrwM</b>
        which are not sent to the server when a page is requested.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        You might want to use Blind Upload for a multi-megabyte file that is too large to be an
        email attachment.  Or perhaps for an attachment that is being blocked by a mail server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud and Office 365, upload your files
        without encryption and they can read the contents.  They wouldn't run automated tools
        that analyse your files, or routinely hand over your data to third parties without warrants,
        would they?
      </p>
      <h3>How do I use Blind Upload?</h3>
      <p>
        Just click the "Browse..." button on the <a href="/upload.html">upload page</a> and choose
        one or more files from your computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your browser will generate a cryptographically secure random key and use that to encrypt
        your files before uploading them to our servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This random key will then be displayed as a link.  Send this link to the intended recipient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or you can install and use <a href="https://github.com/fadedbee/bup">bup</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We store encrypted files for seven days.  After this time, a downloader will be informed
        that the link has expired.
      </p>
      <h3>Who pays for this service?</h3>
      <p>
        If this service becomes popular, we will need to ask for donations.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that doesn't work, we'll need to find a non-Javascript advertising service to pay for
        storage and bandwidth.  (We can't prove that a Javascript advert, or an advertising
        service, won't try to steal links and keys.)
      </p>
      <h3>Should you trust this website?</h3>
      <p>
        No, This website is just a convenience and a proof-of-concept.  You don't know us from
        Adam.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should install <a href="https://github.com/fadedbee/bup">bup</a> and use it instead of
        this website.  You can even inspect the code, and compile it yourself, for complete peace of
        mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we turned evil, we could serve malicious JavaScript and steal your files' keys,
        negating the whole point of this service.  But we could not compromise the security of an
        executable already on your machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        To reassure those who do want to use this website, we serve all of our JavaScript, HTML
        and CSS in fully readable form so that it is easy for other software developers to
        inspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        (We are actively looking for a way to sign our HTML and Javascript with our public key,
        and make browsers require that this has been done.  This would probably require a new
        standard.  That would provide non-repudiation of any evil behaviour, i.e. you could prove
        that malicious content came from us.  Current HTTPS does not allow you to prove to anyone,
        other than yourself, that a particular file has been downloaded from a specific website.)
      </p>
      <h3 id="technically-how-does-it-work">Technically, how does it work?</h3>
      <p>
        Our servers know nothing of files.  To them, everything is just an encrypted block of 1 MB
        or less.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the browser's perspective, each upload consists of data blocks, and an index block.
        Data blocks contain the encrypted contents of the files.  The index block contains the
        files' names and the keys of all of the data blocks, and is also encrypted.  It is the
        index block's key which is displayed after uploading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blocks are identified by truncated
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" target="_">hashes</a>
        of their keys.  Knowing a block's key, you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>generate the block ID under which it is stored,</li>
        <li>use the block ID to downloaded the encrypted block, and</li>
        <li>use the key to decrypt the data from the encrypted block.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The download procedure does this first for the index block, and then uses the keys therein
        to retrieve and decrypt all of the files' data blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        This lets you store and retreive data without Blind Upload being able to decrypt it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A link fragment's forty-three base-62 digits encode 256.03 bits of information.  This is
        sufficient for a single-use AES-256-GCM key.  (We don't need to store the IV as only one
        index block is ever encoded with each key.)
      </p>
      <p>
        (A split key is divided between the link and the telephone code.  The link's twenty-two 
        base-62 digits encode 129.99 bits.  The code's twenty-five base-33 digits encode 126.10
        bits.  We exclude the letters "O" and "I", from the base-33 alphabet, to prevent confusion
        with "0" and "1" and we exclude "U" to prevent accidental profanity.)

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/fadedbee/www.blindupload.org" target="_">The Blind Upload website</a>
        and the 
        <a href="https://github.com/fadedbee/bup" target="_">"bup" utility</a> are
        available as open source software.
      </p>
      <p>
        The back-end code is not yet open-source, as it contains mitigations for site abuse.
